1. Implement Basic Interrupt Handling
Goal: Set up a basic interrupt service routine (ISR) for handling timer or keyboard interrupts.
How:
Configure an interrupt controller (e.g., Generic Interrupt Controller, GIC, on ARM).
Create an ISR in exceptions.S that responds to interrupts by calling appropriate C functions.
Use a timer interrupt to print periodically or perform other tasks without a busy-wait delay.
2. Memory Management
Goal: Implement basic memory management, starting with a simple allocator.
How:
Create a simple memory allocator (e.g., bump allocator or free list).
Set up memory sections (like .bss and .data) with your linker script.
You could move to more complex memory management, such as paging, if targeting a more advanced kernel.
3. Scheduler and Multitasking
Goal: Implement a basic round-robin scheduler to run multiple tasks in sequence.
How:
Create process.c and scheduler.c to handle switching between tasks.
Implement context switching with functions in switch_context.S.
This will help you understand process management, which is key in operating systems.
4. File System and Storage
Goal: Create a simple file system to store and retrieve data.
How:
Start with a RAM-based file system (e.g., a simple flat file structure).
Design functions to read, write, and manage files, and implement basic block I/O if storage is involved.
5. User Space Programs (Optional)
Goal: Add support for loading and running user-space programs.
How:
Implement system calls to allow programs to interact with the kernel.
Create an execution environment with separate memory for user programs and set up privilege levels (EL0 for user, EL1 for kernel on ARM).
6. Networking (Optional)
Goal: Set up basic networking (e.g., using UDP or TCP).
How:
Implement basic networking protocols, using existing hardware interfaces if supported by QEMU.
Create kernel functions for network packet handling and parsing.
7. Debugging and Optimization
Goal: Make your kernel stable and efficient.
How:
Use QEMUâ€™s debugging features or GDB for step-by-step debugging.
Optimize your code, especially in the UART or ISR handling, and reduce any unnecessary overhead.
