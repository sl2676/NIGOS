Phase 1: Basic Kernel Development
Set up the basic bootloader and kernel:
Why: This is essential for understanding how the system boots up and how the CPU interacts with your OS. This will serve as the foundation for all features.
What to do:
Focus on loading the kernel.
Handle basic I/O (e.g., UART).
Set up memory management.
Memory management:
Why: Efficient memory management (heap, stack, paging) is critical for all future functionalities, especially when you are running more complex tasks like gaming and compiling.
What to do:
Implement basic heap and stack management.
Understand the concept of paging (virtual memory).
Basic multitasking (task scheduler):
Why: For running multiple applications, including games and browsers, multitasking is a must.
What to do:
Implement a simple round-robin scheduler.
Manage CPU time for tasks.
Phase 2: Hardware Abstraction Layer and Drivers
Graphics and Input handling (for gaming and UI):
Why: To enable gaming and UI for browsing, you'll need to interact with the graphics card and handle user input (keyboard, mouse).
What to do:
Implement basic graphics output (text, then moving to a GUI).
Set up input drivers for keyboard/mouse.
Network stack for internet browsing:
Why: Browsing the internet requires networking. You will need to implement TCP/IP stack to communicate over the network.
What to do:
Implement a simple TCP/IP stack.
Set up basic networking interfaces like Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
Phase 3: User Space and Tools
Command-line interface (CLI):
Why: Before creating a full-fledged GUI, you'll need a CLI for interacting with your OS and testing core features like networking and compiling.
What to do:
Implement a basic shell.
Allow interaction with the OS (run programs, check logs).
Basic text editor and file system:
Why: You'll need a file system to store and manage data. A basic text editor will be essential for writing code and other configurations.
What to do:
Implement a simple file system (FAT, ext2, or your own).
Write a basic text editor for creating code or text files.
Phase 4: Advanced Features
GUI and web browser:
Why: To browse the internet, youâ€™ll need a GUI for the user to interact with. A basic web browser will rely on your network stack.
What to do:
Implement a simple GUI (window management, buttons, etc.).
Build a simple web browser or port an existing one.
Compiler and Development Tools:
Why: A system for compiling code is a major feature. You'll need tools like a C compiler and build system to enable users to write and compile software on your OS.
What to do:
Implement a simple C compiler or port a small one (e.g., GCC).
Set up a build system (like Make) for compiling software.
Phase 5: System Optimizations and Desktop Compatibility
Enhancing Compatibility with Desktops:
Why: To run the OS on desktops, you'll need to ensure compatibility with standard hardware and support for a wide range of peripherals (printers, displays, etc.).
What to do:
Add support for more hardware devices.
Port the kernel to work with modern desktop environments and processors.
Performance Optimizations:
Why: As more features get added, your OS will need to be optimized to handle gaming, web browsing, and compiling efficiently.
What to do:
Optimize task scheduling, memory usage, and hardware access.
Final Goal:
The end result should be a functional operating system capable of:

Running on desktops (both hardware and software compatibility).
Browsing the internet (with a web browser).
Running games (with a simple GUI and hardware acceleration).
Compiling and running code (with tools like a C compiler).
