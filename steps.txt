Based on the roadmap, the next step is to focus on Phase 1: Basic Kernel Development. You need to set up the foundation of your operating system before adding more advanced features. Here's the breakdown of what you should do next:

1. Finalize Kernel Boot Process:
Why: The boot process is the first step in loading your kernel. This process sets up the environment for your OS to run. You need a reliable bootloader and kernel entry point for your OS.
Action:
Review your current boot.S and kernel.c to ensure that the kernel starts properly.
Ensure that your kernel is able to initialize the CPU and memory correctly, allowing further code execution.
2. Set up UART for Debugging:
Why: For now, you'll use UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) to output messages for debugging. This will help verify that your kernel is working correctly and assist in debugging any further code.
Action:
Make sure the UART is initialized in uart_init() and that you can output debug messages like "Kernel is running!".
Test sending characters to the console using uart_putc() and sending strings with uart_puts().
3. Implement Basic Memory Management:
Why: Memory management (stack, heap) is crucial for any OS. Without it, your OS will not run properly. It's important to have basic memory management before implementing other features.
Action:
Set up a simple memory management system. For now, it can be a fixed memory region for stack and heap (you'll refine this later with paging and dynamic memory allocation).
Start with a static memory allocator for now that will handle the basic heap/stack.
4. Implement Simple Task Scheduler:
Why: The task scheduler is needed to run multiple tasks concurrently. Even if your first task is a simple loop, setting up a scheduler will be essential for adding multitasking in the future.
Action:
Implement a round-robin task scheduler. It can be a simple one for now, just to demonstrate task switching. Set it up to switch between your kernel_main() function and any other tasks you want to add (even if it's just a busy wait loop).
Immediate Next Steps:
Step 1: Debug Boot and Kernel Entry (make sure your kernel can boot up cleanly).
Step 2: Finalize UART for Debugging (ensure your kernel can send output to the screen).
Step 3: Set up a basic memory management (start with static allocation, planning for future paging).
Step 4: Create a simple task scheduler (just a round-robin scheduler to start).
Once these steps are done, youâ€™ll have a functional basic kernel, and you can build from there by adding more advanced features, such as networking and graphics.

Key Focus for This Stage:
Kernel Booting (firm entry point).
Basic debugging with UART.
Initial Memory Management.
Basic Task Scheduling.
Once this phase is complete, you will have a stable base to begin working on the more complex tasks like networking and a GUI.
